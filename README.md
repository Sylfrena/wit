Git implementation in Ocaml

Right now, this is just a way to store the files on the internet.
Ideally, to use git in this case, we need to at least handroll
the 'commit' and 'push' options first.

For now, most of the code is in [try.ml](https://github.com/Sylfrena/wit/blob/main/try.ml).

This is a WIP, be kind.
